**CalDAV MCP Server** is a Model Context Protocol server for managing iCloud Calendar
events, including native support for multiple `VALARM` reminders on one event.

iCloud Calendar is the only provider officially supported and manually validated in the
first release. The server works with any MCP client that supports `stdio` or Streamable
HTTP.

This independent project is not affiliated with, authorized, sponsored, or approved by
Apple Inc. Apple and iCloud are trademarks of their respective owner.

## Quick start

Create an [Apple app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654), then
pick the option for your client.

**Claude Desktop (one click, no Node.js install):** download
[`caldav-mcp.mcpb`](https://github.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp/releases/latest/download/caldav-mcp.mcpb),
open it with Claude Desktop, and enter your Apple Account email and app-specific
password. See [Claude Desktop extension](#claude-desktop-extension-recommended).

**Any other `stdio` client:** install [Node.js 22 or newer](#nodejs-requirements) and
add this server to a JSON-configured MCP client such as Gemini CLI or Claude Code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icloud-calendar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@lukegskw/caldav-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CALDAV_USERNAME": "user@example.com",
        "CALDAV_PASSWORD": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart the client and confirm that it lists six calendar tools. See
[client-specific setup](#mcp-client-setup) and [Docker deployment](#docker-compose)
below. Keep the configuration file private because it contains the app-specific
password.

## About

The server connects one configured account to iCloud through CalDAV. It discovers the
account's calendars and exposes normalized read and write operations through MCP.

Updates preserve the complete iCalendar resource, including unknown properties, Apple
extensions, `VTIMEZONE`, recurrence exceptions, and alarms omitted from a patch. Writes
use opaque resource identifiers and ETags instead of assuming that a CalDAV filename
matches an event UID.

Calendar resources are processed in memory. The server has no telemetry and no
application database, and raw iCalendar is returned only when explicitly requested.

## Features

- Discovers calendars available to the configured iCloud account.
- Lists events in semi-open time ranges and expands recurring occurrences.
- Creates timed, all-day, and recurring events.
- Supports zero, one, or multiple display alarms per event.
- Reads and writes Apple Calendar travel time (`X-APPLE-TRAVEL-DURATION`).
- Emits the Apple alarm extensions expected by iCloud Calendar.
- Reads events by opaque resource ID or by calendar ID and UID.
- Applies partial updates while preserving omitted and unknown iCalendar data.
- Uses ETags for optimistic concurrency on updates and deletions.
- Rejects isolated recurrence mutations instead of changing the complete series.
- Redacts credentials, raw calendar content, and CalDAV paths from logs and errors.
- Runs as a non-root container with a read-only root filesystem configuration.
- Supports `stdio` and Streamable HTTP MCP transports.

## MCP tools

### `list_calendars`

Lists the calendars discovered for the configured account. Each result includes an
opaque `calendar_id`, display name, description, timezone, and best-effort write status.

### `list_events`

Lists events in a semi-open interval and expands recurring occurrences. The maximum
range is 366 days, the default page size is 100, and the maximum page size is 500.
Results use a deterministic chronological order. Pagination cursors are opaque and
do not represent a snapshot when events are modified during traversal.

Example input:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "opaque-calendar-id",
  "start": "2026-09-01T00:00:00Z",
  "end": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z",
  "timezone": "Europe/Berlin",
  "limit": 100
}
```

### `get_event`

Reads an event by `resource_id`, or by a `calendar_id` and UID pair. Raw iCalendar is
excluded by default and can be requested with `include_raw_ical: true` for controlled
diagnostics.

### `create_event`

Creates an event and reads back the representation stored by the server.

Timed event with two alarms:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "opaque-calendar-id",
  "summary": "Buy Shinkansen tickets",
  "start": {
    "date_time": "2026-09-06T03:00:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
  },
  "end": {
    "date_time": "2026-09-06T03:30:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
  },
  "description": "Smart-EX",
  "location": null,
  "alarms": [
    { "minutes_before": 1440, "action": "DISPLAY" },
    { "minutes_before": 0, "action": "DISPLAY" }
  ],
  "rrule": null
}
```

All-day event with an exclusive end date:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "opaque-calendar-id",
  "summary": "Trip",
  "start": { "date": "2026-09-06" },
  "end": { "date": "2026-09-08" },
  "alarms": []
}
```

Recurring events accept an RFC 5545 rule without the `RRULE:` prefix:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "opaque-calendar-id",
  "summary": "Weekly planning",
  "start": {
    "date_time": "2026-09-07T09:00:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
  },
  "end": {
    "date_time": "2026-09-07T09:30:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Berlin"
  },
  "rrule": "FREQ=WEEKLY;BYDAY=MO;COUNT=10"
}
```

Timed event with 30 minutes of Apple Calendar travel time:

```json
{
  "calendar_id": "opaque-calendar-id",
  "summary": "Dentist",
  "start": {
    "date_time": "2026-10-05T10:00:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam"
  },
  "end": {
    "date_time": "2026-10-05T10:30:00+02:00",
    "timezone": "Europe/Amsterdam"
  },
  "travel_minutes": 30
}
```

`travel_minutes` accepts whole minutes from 1 to 1,440 and is only valid for timed
events. It is stored as `X-APPLE-TRAVEL-DURATION`, which Apple Calendar shows as
travel time before the event. Events returned by the read tools include
`travel_minutes`, or `null` when none is set.

### `update_event`

Patches an event or complete recurring series. Omitted fields are preserved, `null`
removes a nullable field, and `alarms: []` removes all alarms. `travel_minutes: null`
removes travel time, including Apple's automatic travel-time metadata. An optional
`expected_etag` prevents overwriting a newer server version.

### `delete_event`

Deletes an event or complete recurring series, optionally requiring an observed ETag.
Deleting a single expanded occurrence is not supported in the current release.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- An iCloud account with Calendar enabled.
- Two-factor authentication enabled for the Apple Account.
- An [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102654).
- Docker and Docker Compose for container deployment, Node.js 22+ for `npx`, or
  Claude Desktop for the one-click extension.
- pnpm is required only when building from source. Corepack and CI use the version
  pinned in `package.json`.

### Node.js requirements

| Use                                   | Node.js                                                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Claude Desktop extension (`.mcpb`)    | None to install; Claude Desktop uses its built-in Node.js          |
| `npx` or a global npm install         | 22 LTS or newer; CI tests 22 and 24                                |
| Docker image                          | None to install; the image ships Node.js 24                        |
| Building from source and contributing | 22.13 or newer, required by ESLint 10 and Vitest 5; 24 recommended |

`engines.node` in `package.json` is `>=22`. Node.js 20 reached end of life in April 2026
and is not supported; npm prints an `EBADENGINE` warning on older versions. Check the
version your MCP client will use with `node --version`. Desktop clients may use a
different `node` than your terminal, so if a client cannot start the server, point it at
the absolute path of a Node.js 22+ `npx` (`command -v npx` on macOS/Linux, `where npx`
on Windows).

### npm / npx

No global install or repository clone is required. MCP clients can launch the latest
published package directly:

```sh
CALDAV_USERNAME='user@example.com' \
CALDAV_PASSWORD='xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' \
npx --yes @lukegskw/caldav-mcp@latest
```

The command waits for MCP messages on stdin and normally prints nothing to stdout. In
practice, add it to the client configuration as shown in [MCP client setup](#mcp-client-setup).
For reproducible environments, replace `latest` with an exact published version such as
`X.Y.Z`.

### Docker Compose

The recommended installation uses the published multi-architecture image:

```text
ghcr.io/lukegskw/caldav-mcp:latest
```

Download the Compose example:

```sh
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp/main/compose.example.yaml
```

Provide the Apple Account email and app-specific password, then start the service:

```sh
export CALDAV_USERNAME='user@example.com'
export CALDAV_PASSWORD='xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx'
docker compose -f compose.example.yaml up -d
```

To publish a different host port, set:

```sh
export CALDAV_MCP_PUBLISHED_PORT=18100
docker compose -f compose.example.yaml up -d
```

The `latest` tag follows the newest stable release. Stable releases also publish an
exact tag such as `0.1.6` and a minor-series tag such as `0.1`. The Compose example
pins `latest` by digest so deployments are reproducible. To upgrade, download the
updated Compose example or replace the full image reference with the desired
published version and digest.

The Streamable HTTP endpoint will be available at:

```text
http://<host>:8100/mcp
```

The host port can change without changing port `8100` inside the container. No
persistent volume is required; calendar data remains in iCloud.

### Docker run

The same hardened container configuration can be started directly:

```sh
docker run -d \
  --name caldav-mcp \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  --read-only \
  --user 10001:10001 \
  --cap-drop ALL \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges:true \
  --tmpfs /tmp:size=16m,mode=1777 \
  -e CALDAV_PROVIDER=icloud \
  -e CALDAV_USERNAME \
  -e CALDAV_PASSWORD \
  -e CALDAV_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http \
  -e CALDAV_MCP_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -p 8100:8100 \
  ghcr.io/lukegskw/caldav-mcp:latest
```

### Build the container from source

Building locally is optional. Prefer the published image unless you need to modify or
audit the container build.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp.git
cd caldav-mcp
docker buildx build --load -t caldav-mcp:local .
```

### Local Node.js installation

Building from source requires Node.js 22.13 or newer; Node.js 24 is recommended.
Builds and typechecks use TypeScript 7. The `typescript` dependency aliases
`@typescript/typescript6` for ESLint, which still requires the TypeScript 6 API;
`@typescript/native` supplies TypeScript 7’s `tsc` executable. See the
[TypeScript migration guidance](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-7-0/#running-side-by-side-with-typescript-6.0).

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp.git
cd caldav-mcp
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cp .env.example .env
pnpm build
pnpm start -- --transport stdio
```

In `stdio` mode, stdout is reserved exclusively for MCP messages. To run Streamable HTTP
locally:

```sh
CALDAV_MCP_TRANSPORT=streamable-http pnpm start
```

## Configuration

All settings use the `CALDAV_` or `CALDAV_MCP_` prefix.

| Variable                        | Required | Default                     | Description                                       |
| ------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `CALDAV_PROVIDER`               | No       | `icloud`                    | Provider policy. iCloud is the supported profile. |
| `CALDAV_URL`                    | No       | `https://caldav.icloud.com` | CalDAV discovery URL.                             |
| `CALDAV_USERNAME`               | Yes      | None                        | Apple Account email.                              |
| `CALDAV_PASSWORD`               | Yes      | None                        | App-specific password, not the account password.  |
| `CALDAV_MCP_TRANSPORT`          | No       | `stdio`                     | `stdio` or `streamable-http`.                     |
| `CALDAV_MCP_HOST`               | No       | `0.0.0.0`                   | HTTP bind address.                                |
| `CALDAV_MCP_PORT`               | No       | `8100`                      | HTTP listening port.                              |
| `CALDAV_MCP_LOG_LEVEL`          | No       | `INFO`                      | Application log level.                            |
| `CALDAV_MCP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | No       | `30000`                     | CalDAV request timeout.                           |

The core retains an experimental `generic` provider policy and configurable URL to keep
Apple extensions isolated from the shared iCalendar implementation. No compatibility
with other providers is currently claimed.

Secrets must be supplied through the deployment platform or environment. Never commit
`.env`, pass credentials as MCP tool arguments, or include them in diagnostic reports.

## MCP client setup

### Claude Desktop extension (recommended)

Claude Desktop for macOS and Windows installs the server as a one-click
[MCP Bundle](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/mcpb) and runs it with its built-in
Node.js:

1. Download
   [`caldav-mcp.mcpb`](https://github.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp/releases/latest/download/caldav-mcp.mcpb)
   from the latest release.
2. Open it with Claude Desktop (double-click it, or drag it onto
   **Settings -> Extensions**) and choose **Install**.
3. Enter the Apple Account email and app-specific password. The password is stored as
   a sensitive setting.

To upgrade, install the `.mcpb` from a newer release. See
[Claude Desktop extension](docs/claude-desktop-extension.md) for bundle contents and
how it is built and released.

### Gemini CLI extension

Install directly from GitHub and enable automatic extension updates:

```sh
gemini extensions install https://github.com/lukegskw/caldav-mcp --auto-update
```

Gemini prompts for the username and stores the app-specific password as a sensitive
setting. The public extension gallery discovers tagged releases from this repository.

### Manual configuration

For any MCP client that accepts Streamable HTTP server definitions, configure the URL:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  caldav:
    url: http://<host>:8100/mcp
```

If the client shares the Compose network, use the service name and internal port:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  caldav:
    url: http://caldav-mcp:8100/mcp
```

For clients that launch local `stdio` servers, prefer the npm command from
[Quick start](#quick-start). If a desktop client cannot find `npx`, use the absolute
path reported by `command -v npx` on macOS/Linux or `where npx` on Windows.

#### Claude Desktop

The [extension](#claude-desktop-extension-recommended) is the simplest option. To
configure the server manually instead, add the [Quick start](#quick-start) JSON under
`mcpServers` in `claude_desktop_config.json`, then completely restart Claude Desktop.
Open the file through **Settings -> Developer -> Edit Config** instead of assuming its
location.

#### Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) can add the same `stdio` server at
user scope:

```sh
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope user \
  --env CALDAV_USERNAME=user@example.com \
  --env CALDAV_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
  icloud-calendar -- npx --yes @lukegskw/caldav-mcp@latest
```

This command places the values in Claude's MCP configuration. Avoid running it where
shell history is shared or retained insecurely.

#### Codex

Codex can add the server to its shared CLI and IDE configuration:

```sh
codex mcp add icloud-calendar \
  --env CALDAV_USERNAME=user@example.com \
  --env CALDAV_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx \
  -- npx --yes @lukegskw/caldav-mcp@latest
```

Run `codex mcp list` to verify it. For finer control, use the
[official Codex MCP configuration](https://developers.openai.com/codex/mcp/) in
`~/.codex/config.toml` or a project-scoped `.codex/config.toml`.

#### Gemini CLI

Following the [Gemini CLI MCP configuration](https://geminicli.com/docs/tools/mcp-server/),
add the server under `mcpServers` in `~/.gemini/settings.json` (user scope) or the
project's `.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icloud-calendar": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["--yes", "@lukegskw/caldav-mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "CALDAV_USERNAME": "user@example.com",
        "CALDAV_PASSWORD": "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop (Docker, stdio alternative)

Claude Desktop launches local `stdio` servers as subprocesses. Running the published
container this way keeps the app-specific password on the client machine and opens no
network port, which matches the transport guidance in [Limitations](#limitations).

Add the server to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "icloud-calendar": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--env-file",
        "/absolute/path/to/caldav-mcp.env",
        "-e",
        "CALDAV_PROVIDER=icloud",
        "-e",
        "CALDAV_MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio",
        "ghcr.io/lukegskw/caldav-mcp@sha256:<digest>"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

`-i` is required. Without an attached stdin the client cannot speak MCP to the
container. `--rm` removes the container once the client stops it.

Supply credentials through `--env-file` rather than `-e`. Arguments passed to
`docker run` are visible in the host process list; the contents of an env file are not.
The file holds the variables described in [Configuration](#configuration):

```
CALDAV_USERNAME=user@example.com
CALDAV_PASSWORD=xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
```

Pin the image by digest instead of `latest`, so that restarting the client cannot
silently start a different version:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/lukegskw/caldav-mcp:latest
docker images --digests ghcr.io/lukegskw/caldav-mcp
```

Restart Claude Desktop completely after editing the configuration file.

##### Windows

When Claude Desktop is installed from the Microsoft Store, Windows redirects
`%APPDATA%\Claude` into the package container and the file lives at:

```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\Packages\Claude_<package-id>\LocalCache\Roaming\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
```

In that case `dir %APPDATA%\Claude` reports nothing. Server logs are written next to the
configuration file, in `logs\mcp-server-<server-name>.log`.

Use the absolute path to `docker.exe`, because `PATH` inside the package container is
not reliable. `where docker` prints it, typically
`C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker.exe`. Backslashes must be escaped
in JSON.

Configuration formats differ between MCP clients. Consult the client's documentation
for its exact schema and reload or restart it after changing the server definition.

## Verification

Check the container state and logs:

```sh
docker compose -f compose.example.yaml ps
docker compose -f compose.example.yaml logs caldav-mcp
```

The container should report `healthy`. The TCP healthcheck validates the server process,
not iCloud credentials.

Run the repository verification suite:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:integration
pnpm build
pnpm test:package
pnpm test:distribution
pnpm build:mcpb
pnpm test:mcpb
```

Finally, connect with an MCP client and confirm that all six tools are listed.

## Limitations

- One iCloud account is configured per server process or container.
- The Streamable HTTP endpoint has no authentication in the current release. Restrict it
  to a trusted LAN, VPN, or private container network; do not expose it directly to the
  internet.
- Individual recurrence occurrences are read-only. Updating or deleting the complete
  series is supported.
- Only `ACTION:DISPLAY` alarms are created.
- Individual iCalendar resources are limited to 5 MiB.
- Event list ranges are limited to 366 days and pages to 500 results.
- Events may contain at most 20 alarms.
- Attendee scheduling is outside the current scope.
- Providers other than iCloud are not officially supported.

Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before reporting a security
issue or attaching diagnostics.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before opening a pull request:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm format:check
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm build
docker buildx build --load -t caldav-mcp:test .
```

Changes to CalDAV writes or iCalendar serialization must preserve ETag checks, opaque
resource boundaries, unknown properties, recurrence exceptions, and alarms omitted from
patches. TypeScript changes must continue to satisfy the rules in
[`.codex/rules/typescript.md`](.codex/rules/typescript.md).

## Releasing

Releases are version-driven and automated from `main` so that a partial registry outage
can be retried without publishing a second npm version.

1. Prepare the new version with `pnpm release:prepare X.Y.Z`. This synchronizes the npm,
   MCP Registry, Gemini, and MCP Bundle (`manifest.json`) metadata.
2. Run the verification suite, including `pnpm test:distribution` and `pnpm test:mcpb`.
3. Commit and push the release changes to `main`.
4. The release workflow validates the commit and creates the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag
   automatically before publishing.

The release workflow validates the versions, tests the packed npm artifact and the
Claude Desktop bundle, and publishes the exact, minor-series, and `latest` container
tags together with the npm package, MCP Registry entry, and GitHub release with
`caldav-mcp.mcpb` attached. Prereleases receive only their exact
container tag. Gemini can discover the tagged extension without another per-release
edit. A rerun skips matching artifacts that already exist and resumes the missing
steps. See [Claude Desktop extension](docs/claude-desktop-extension.md) for building,
testing, and shipping the `.mcpb` bundle.
